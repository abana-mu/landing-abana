Popularised in the form of blue jeans, denim - the twill cotton fabric, has been re-invented over and over again for its versatility across all styles, gender and age.

Despite eco-fashion gaining much importance over the last decade, a fully sustainable production is a challenge due to the complex apparel supply chain. For instance, the cotton is grown, harvested and spun into yarn, the yarn is dyed and woven into fabric, which eventually is cut and sewn into a garment.

On average, a pair of jeans travel a distance of 65,000km throughout the globalised supply chain before reaching the shops. This lengthy process also comes at an environmental cost requiring heavy water, chemical and energy use.

* Cotton, the most used fibre in denim is the 3rd biggest water-consumer plant
* Cotton agriculture is reliant on heavy use of pesticides & fertilisers toxic to farmers
* 7000-10,000L is needed to manufacture a pair of jeans
* Hazardous chemical use in dyeing & finishing can be a threat to workers’ health & safety



The ugly truth of denim needs to be addressed and the shift to ecological alternatives is inevitable if we hope to preserve what became a timeless and universal wardrobe staple. To highlight some sustainable industry leaders, ABANA visited two denim factories based in Mauritius - FM Denim, a weaving mill and REAL Garments, a denim garment manufacturer.

According to [Rachel Deeley](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/fashions-untapped-opportunity-to-fight-climate-change/), the ‘dirtiest’ part of the supply chain takes place in the making of the fabric due to intensive energy, water and chemical consumption. As brands often do not directly communicate with mills to oversee their processes, it has been challenging to influence their operations. However, FM Denim proves the contrary - that factories can take action on their own and be

the change. Since their launch 14 years ago, their objective was to be different by doing the right thing, as their motto indicates, “Weaving while caring for our planet”.

Being part of the vertically-integrated FM Group is the strength of FM Denim as they enjoy the autonomy of being selective over every step of their production from blowing and carding the cotton, spinning, dyeing, weaving and finishing.



Sales & Marketing Manager Razia Sayed-Fakim shared about their SUSTAINBILITY-2025 Denim project initiated in 2010 which has successfully reduced the factory’s carbon footprint by 50%, and their “Less Water” denim range saving up to 90% of fresh water.



FM Denim also leads the way by promoting and carefully selecting ecological alternatives for raw materials and chemicals used in dyeing and finishing. Their product range includes recycled polyester, BCI cotton, cellulosic fibres and soon will include organic cotton. To promote African industries, African cotton is preferred due to its premium quality and location proximity to Mauritius which lowers their carbon emission.

Continuously setting high standards, FM Denim believes their role is to innovate, influence and collaborate towards a genuinely sustainable and circular system with the aim to operate their facilities with a zero carbon emissions in a near future.



**REAL Garments**

“Sustainability is not the future, it’s the present” is what Imtinen Hamlaoui the Sustainability Manager, and Tibye Dansi the Marketing Director of REAL Garments told us at the factory. Trusted for impeccable quality and high ethical standards, REAL Garments works with luxury brands such as PVH Group, Diesel, Armani etc.



Striving to be the best, their goal is to build sustainable efficiency in line with the global carbon budget COP21 within the next 3 years. Jeanologia machines were acquired to combine industrial productivity, energy efficiency and human respect while creating limitless designs with laser. Cutting-edge technology using Ozone washing also reduced their water consumption significantly from 500L to 50L per wash.

Substantial operational changes requires high investment in latest technology. Tibye approaches sustainability with a sense of urgency and responsibility rather than an obligation. He optimistically embraces the silver linings of what change can bring.



The search of sustainable practices is the opportunity to revisit techniques which have been forgotten. Their non-toxic natural-dye collection of beautiful pastel colours shows how trends, style and ecology can go hand in hand.



A balance between planet and profit is the equilibrium REAL Garments hopes to maintain in the long term.

In the midst of uncertain times, sustainability remains a top priority for FM Denim and REAL Garments, their lifeline is to ensure that denim is produced ecologically and ethically.

Razia sees sustainability as a revolution which should be inclusive and tackled from all perspectives. Brands have the responsibility to educate their consumers and provide sustainably made products. But she argues that meaningful change can only happen when conversations about sustainable development are normalised and woven into cultural, educational and governmental spaces.



As a woman, Razia additionally highlights the socio-economic opportunities created by the fashion ecosystem\
for women to become independent, contribute to the progress of family life and their country. The apparel industry is a socio-economic pillar for Mauritius, and its development should be valued with sustainability at its core.



***“Sustainability is the present, not the future”***



Fashion is a transformative agent empowering people creatively and economically. The ambitions of FM Denim and REAL Garments only prove that profit and purpose can be aligned once sustainability becomes an inherent culture to any business.
