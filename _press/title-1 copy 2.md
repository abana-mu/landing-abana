Last week, our CEO Dirk Robens had the pleasure to speak to Jane Singer, the Managing Director of Inside Fashion who hosts the podcast “A Seat at the Table”. This channel features senior executives around the world who share their insights, experiences and future vision. It was a great privilege for us to introduce ABANA as a promising solution to the challenges of apparel sourcing in Africa.

Jane recognised the unique capabilities which the ABANA platform brings to industry players to facilitate sourcing in Africa, and strengthen partnerships within the whole ecosystem.

# **A Seat at the Table: Leadership, Innovation & Vision for a New Era**

## A New Platform that Helps Buyers Source in Africa

“Africa has been rising to the top of many buyers’ ‘need to look into’ list.\
\
However the vastness of the continent - and the diversity amongst regions - makes this a daunting task.\
\
A new platform aims to make this easier by gathering key supplier information and organising it in an easy to search database.\
\
Not only that, the platform provides an entire ecosystem that ties in support services from inspection to freelance designers.\
\
Today I’m speaking with Dirk Robens, CEO of ABANA, a digital solution for discovering Africa’s apparel manufacturers.\
\
Dirk has spent over 30 years in the apparel industry, both on the manufacturing side as well as serving as Sourcing Director for Mr. Price Group, Africa’s largest retailer.\
\
He’ll be explaining what ABANA offers, as well as giving us a closer look at sourcing opportunities in Africa.\
\
Mauritius and Madagascar in particular have a long history as knitwear suppliers. As African nations, they also have duty-free status to both the EU and the US, as well as the ability to handle small orders with short lead times.”
